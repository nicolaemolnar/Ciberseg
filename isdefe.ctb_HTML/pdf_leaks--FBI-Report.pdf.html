<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>FBI-Report.pdf</h1><br/>After opening the extracted file, we obtain the following information:<br /><a href=""><img src="images/15-1.png" alt="images/15-1.png" /></a><br /><br />As seen above, this file seems a report from the FBI about a crime operation. The interesting point about the file is that it has censored data where the links to the data should be.<br />Nevertheless, after hovering the cursor over one of the censored lines, we noticed the following situation:<br /><a href=""><img src="images/15-2.png" alt="images/15-2.png" /></a><br />That pop up means the censored lines are actually black highlighted lines, which means that with any pdf editor, like Adobe Acrobat DC, we could possibly uncensor the data. Let&#39;s give it a try:<br /><a href=""><img src="images/15-3.png" alt="images/15-3.png" /></a><br />As expected, we can delete the highlight and obtain the censored data, within the links obtained we found this link:<br /><a href=""><img src="images/15-4.png" alt="images/15-4.png" /></a><br />Which reveals the flag <em><strong>flag{fbiredacteddocument}</strong></em>, that means we solved the problem.</div>
